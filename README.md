# Work-Day-Scheduler
A simple calendar application that allows user to record events for each hour of the day, created using jQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap. 

The application starts with empty text fields corresponding to 9AM-5PM. The user can input event information into the text fields and hit save. Upon saving, the information is stored in local storage and can therefore be accessed even if the page is reloaded or closed.
